Overview and goals
Kitvault aims to be a robust platform for buying soccer jerseys. The goal is to deliver a fast, secure, and scalable storefront that behaves reliably under load. It should feel familiar to developers and easy to extend for teams and merchants.

Key objectives
- Provide a clean, consistent API for front-end clients and third-party integrators.
- Enable smooth shopping flows, from product browsing to checkout and order tracking.
- Ensure strong security for user accounts, payments, and administrative actions.
- Support a responsive UI that works well on mobile and desktop.
- Integrate with Stripe to handle checkout, payments, and refunds with proper webhooks.
- Use PostgreSQL as a solid, scalable data store with well-defined schemas.
- Keep the code accessible to developers new to the project, with clear guidance and tests.

Core features
- User accounts with secure authentication (JWT-based).
- Product catalog with categories, filters, and search.
- Shopping cart and persistent user carts.
- Checkout integrated with Stripe for secure payments.
- Order management with status updates (pending, paid, fulfilled, shipped, cancelled).
- Admin panel for product management, order processing, and reports.
- Robust API surface for third-party apps and front-end frameworks.
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and accessible components.
- Logging, error handling, and monitoring hooks to aid debugging.
- Data migrations and seed data for quick setup.
- Testing hooks to validate business logic and API behavior.

Architecture and design
- Layered architecture: API layer, business logic layer, and data access layer.
- Stateless REST API with JWT authentication for secure access control.
- Clear boundary between server-side API and client-side UI.
- Separation of concerns: products, users, orders, payments, and inventory are modeled as distinct modules.
- Event-driven hooks for key actions like order creation and payment success.
- Webhook endpoints for Stripe to confirm payment events and update order status.

7) Optional: docker-compose (for a production-like setup)
   - docker-compose up -d
   - Compose file includes: app, db, and a reverse proxy service
   - Ensure environment variables are set in the compose file or via environment files mounted into containers

Environment configuration
- SECURITY
  - JWT_SECRET: keep this value secret; rotate if needed
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: come from Stripe; keep publishable key public, secret key private
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: used to verify Stripe webhooks
- DATABASE
  - DATABASE_URL: connection string for PostgreSQL
  - Use pooling and proper timeouts for production
- APP BEHAVIOR
  - PORT: server port
  - NODE_ENV: development or production
